Unicycle Lights
==============

FPGA programmed unicycle lights
This is designed for a Digilent Nexys with a Spartan3 FPGA, but will likely work on other boards. In order to synthesize the code and program the FPGA, I used the xilinx ISE design suite. The constraints file can be edited in order to make the code compatible with other boards.
